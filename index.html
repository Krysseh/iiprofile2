<h1>The O'Dama Princess</h1>
<b>Name:</b> Beta O'Dama<br>
<b>Alias:</b> II (2, or, second)<br>
<b>Age:</b> Immortal, appears to be frozen developmentally around the human age of 23.<br>
<b>Date of Birth:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Cisgender Female<br>
<b>Sexuality:</b> Demisexual<br>
<b>Species:</b> Kitsune<br>
<b>Race:</b> O'Dama<br>
<b>Current Occupation:</b> Student at Seior Academy<br>
<b>Talents:</b> Mana, RuneCraft, LightSpectrum, and Singing<br>
<b>School Rank:</b> Nerd<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
II is considerate and respectful of other creatures in the sense that she believes every being deserves to be alive. She does not fight without good reason and tends to detest those who do. However, this does not mean she's timid or quiet, she will most certainly speak her mind, she just might soften the delivery. That being said, II is very straightforward and honest with those close to her (such as family and friends).  The female enjoys some human pleasures such as donuts and beef stew, but detests the concept of money and "unfair trade." This is nothing in comparison for her hate of the common "half-blood" descendant of the Kitsune race, who sell their bodies for momentary pleasure or even to inflict torment. Nothing disgusts her more than a good old fashioned neko.
<br><br>
<b>Her Story</b><br>
II is the firstborn of I's children. She carries the responsibility of "Beta" and the possibility of "Alpha" should her father pass on. Her rank would compare to that as a "High Princess" in the human world. As the years passed since her birth, II was one of the first of her family to leave the nest and explore the world for herself. Some of this time was spent in the wilds and some among the world of men. She'd fought in many battles, wars, made many enemies and friends, and managed to lose them all too. Her experiences have made her very wise and open minded about the worlds and races around her. The princess's father is quite convinced that she is ready to take his place should he pass at any time, but the younger female is not so sure and wonders if she really wants that crown. Every year she anxiously travels home for the Festival of Jewels (a gathering in which all Kitsunes come together to celebrate the O'Damas) in hopes that he is still alive, but she can't decide if it's his health she cares for, or the responsibility of his title she fears.
<br>
Similar to most common races, each person within the race has skills and talents that set them apart from their fellow creatures. II has her own special talent that increases her individuality from her father and her siblings: she can sing. Her voice is liquid smooth like honey, and glides through the air like a bird. The Beta's father recognized her talent and invested in a way that would enable his daughter to use this skill as a powerful weapon. His investments paid off, as he found the younger woman a teacher who was well renown for his music-based-magics. Now victims and attackers must beware, that hum may be more than just a tune, but also a bringer of death.

<div id="tab1">
<h1>Humanoid Form</h1>
<b>Height/Weight</b><br>
From the top of her head to the tip of her toes, II stands at 5'6" and weighs 110 lbs. She is thinly built and light, just like a fox, built more for speed and agility.
<br>
<b>Hair/Facial</b><br>
Her hair is very long, reaching all the way to her upper thighs when straight, but it's hard to tell really considering she almost always has it braided and put up. Its color in the daytime would seem to be a dark dull grey, but like her inherent tree, in the moonlight it glimmers many colors and looks more like a rainbow (see image on "II" tab). II has a slender oval face with gently pronouned cheekbones and eyes that match her hair, dull grey in the sunlight and many many colors in the moonlight.
<br>
<b>Animalistic Attributes</b><br>
O'Damas are not like their bretheren when it comes to their fox-give-aways on their humanistic bodies. They have needle-teeth no matter what form they take, and very interesting fox ears that sit atop their heads. Some speculate that they look more like crystallized transparent horns but they are actually soft to the touch and move just like the ears of any other animal. At night, they reflect the colors of II's hair (see also the picture under the tab titled "II"). O'Damas do not have "tails" unless they have undergone a huge trial of honor and are rewarded with one. II has yet to undergo said trial and so the only reference to her true form remain her ears and her teeth.
<br><br>
<h1>True Form</h1>
<b>Height/Weight</b><br>
In her true basic form, II stands 14.2 hands high (about the average universal size for a small horse) and weighs about as much as a feather. This is because Kitsunes are a spiritual presence and have "tangible" bodies made of spiritual essences (this essence varies for each individual.)
<br>
<b>Fur/Body</b><br>
The Kitsune's fur is lighter than her hair in her human form, but has the same effect. Dull grey in the sun, fiery multitude of colors under the moon. Like in the picture provided, her legs and face remain a dark black no matter the time of day. Even though she is considerably larger than the average fox, she is still thin, lithe, and agile. The only thing out of regular porportion is her long tail. Yes she has yet to earn her humanoid tail, but every O'Dama is born with one in their true form.
<br>
<b>Distinguishing Features</b><br>
Rune-like markings cover her body and constantly glow a white-blue. These runes are an ancient language that mark her identity (such as her name and her titles) but the knowledge of what they say will not be passed down until they have "earned their tail."
</div>

<div id="tab2">
<h1>Racials</h1>
<b>Shift</b><br>
The simple act of shifting between their humanoid and true form.
<br>
<b>Illusion</b><br>
Kitsunes are masters of illusionary magic, they naturally tend to take on this craft and seem to be practically "made" for it. They can use their energy to make their victims believe that certain items are other things (ie; a stick is a snake), completely fabricate hallucinations, or, cloud over specific things and hide them from recognition.
<br>
<b>Heightened Sense</b><br>
Foxes on their own have noses and ears three times as sensitive as that of a dog's. The Kitsunes were designed after these mortal counterparts and therefore have the same sort of instincts and sensibilities. Even in their humanoid forms, all Kitsunes have incredible hearing and sense of smell, making human cities hard on them, and hard to sneak up on in the wilds.
<br>
<b>Diamond Tears</b><br>
Ah, now we finally come to the talent that gives the infamous "Jewel Fox Spirit" its name, their tears. You see, deep within that tree of illusions, inside its very heart, rested a sap that would have been the ultimate human cure-all had it ever been found. Instead of a fruit, Lord I was born from this sap. It is said that when an O'Dama cries, this sap flows from within them which is partially true. An O'Dama can cry just like any other creature, normal tears of water and salt, but there are special occasions in which they will cry these legendary tears. Not only are the Diamond Tears renown for their incredible healing properties, but they can be collected and hardened to make the hardest substance yet known to man, a strong material to rival even diamonds themselves. This makes O'Damas highly sought after and desired, however, to get these special tears out of them is a challenging task and there are so few O'Damas to begin with. The few items made from their tears are kept tight within their possession, guarded by the king himself.
<br>
<b>Solidification</b><br>
II has a defensive ability that her siblings did not inherit oddly enough, even though they should have. Oh well. You see, the sap earlier mentioned that is the source of the "Diamond Tear" actually runs within their veins, but when in "blood form" it is incredibly toxic. When they cry, their blood basically goes through toxin purification and comes out of their eyes, leaving only the healing substance behind. However, if II were to cut herself deep enough to draw blood, she can force her blood to come out of her skin (a painful bleeding-through-the-pores process) and coat her body. She can then harden it into a protective armor to withstand an assault. This is only temporary though, and prevents movement, so full body isn't always her go-to. Sometimes she might solidify an arm or a leg and use it to block an attack.
<br><br>
<h1>All The Colors Of Tone</h1>
<b>Red is for Blood; C</b><br>
Upon simply singing the note (in any octave she can/desires to) the note or rhythm will appear in the air in the color "red." If one is not close enough to see the note appearing, they will realize soon enough what is going on. II would emit a scent of blood in a 300 ft radius from herself, the closer to her one was, the stronger the smell will be until eventually it would be so strong that they would taste the blood as well as smell it. There is, of course, no real blood anywhere. This is a spell combined with her racial illusion skills and is often used to confuse or "throw off" enemies with its shock factor.
<br>
<b>Orange is for Fire; D</b><br>
When singing this note, again it will appear in the air in a bright blazing orange, however, this isn't the only thing that will appear. D activates a hot burst of flame to shoot at whatever II's  current target may be.
<br>
<b>Yellow is for Lightning; E</b><br>
Upon singing this frequency with the yellow note appearing, in a similar projectile fashion to D, E will produce a burst of electricity as a projectile toward a specific target.
<br>
<b>Green is for Gas; F</b><br>
This is a powerful illusion that may very well cause the brain to voluntarily shut down vital organs or even itself as it would be completely convinced that the body is dying. One of the most dangerous illusions. The potency of this spell is equal at any distance from II within its range/zone(which is much much smaller than the C spell). With the appearance of the green note in the air, there will be a powerful illusion of green poisonous gas seeping into the air. The basis that this is an illusion spell, and it is airborn, will trick the mind into believing it is enhaling poison to such an extent that the brain may even be tricked into shutting down parts of the body it believes to be "infected." No worries though, the range is very small, around only ten feet.
<br>
<b>Blue is for Cold; G</b><br>
This note is not an illusion. This rune-like note will appear blue and upon its activation will drop the temperature within a 10o foot radius of II into freezing temperatures, hardening the ground, freezing the water, and feeding off the thermal heat of the "flies" caught within her "trap."
<br>
<b>Purple is for Mirrors; A</b><br>
A is a zoning spell which can be sung into existence, but does not activate until stepped into or otherwise activated. This is another illusion based spell that surrounds the victim with a multitude of mirrors, connected to each other by their frames, and each holding a reflection of the victim as the embodiment of their own hatred or fears. Depending on the strength of mind of the victim, they will simply see the reflections or actually believe them to be fleeing from their mirrors in order to attack the victim. This can be a very mind damaging snare. However, it's a little hard to set considering the cursed area would be a purple note stamped into the ground.
<br>
<b>White is for Black; B</b><br>
When sung, this runic note will appear in a sudden flash of intense bright light, bright enough to cause temporary blindness, giving the spell its name. (Haha get it? Cuz everything starts out white then fades to black? .. oh nevermind.)
<br><br>
<h1>Augmentation and Diminution</h1>
When a note is augmented it gets "higher" (C to Csharp) and when a note is diminuted it gets "lower" (C to Cflat).  Colorwise when a note is augmented, it gets lighter and when it is diminuted it gets darker. There are three possible shades for each color in the system of tones (listed above). When a spell is augmented it strengthens in potency. For this to work, II must start out by singing the original note and then add on the augmented note. The same rules apply for diminution. However, a diminuted note will weaken the spells potency.

<div id="tab3">
<h1>History of the O'Dama</h1>
Residing in the world, hidden in plain sight thanks to a defensive technique called camouflage, there are beautiful trees that grow big and strong. These trees as you may have guessed, are not like the others around them, they're embedded with supernatural energies. In the beginning, these trees were gifts to the first men from their gods, some had roots and leaves with medicinal properties while others had barrier-like energies that protected. The people they were gifted to formed entire kingdoms with their tree at the base and everything was good for some time. However, the greed of man took over, for each kingdom was not content with just their one tree, and some even schemed to take them all. Wars began and blood was
shed. The gods became very angry and disgusted with their people, regretting their own privileged gifts. So for the first time in history, the mystical trees bore fruit. From this fruit arose races of supernatural beings, and they took the energies and capabilities of their trees with them. These creatures were much more powerful than the humans (especially since the trees no longer held power and they could not use them in battle against the new races) and quickly wiped out the self righteous kingdoms of men.
<br><br>
This was, of course, not the end of man by any means. Their race banded together and left the ruins of their old homes, finding refuge elsewhere and starting over. Meanwhile, the creatures--whom were given the name "demons" by the humans--separated themselves by "tree" or "race" and spread out through the land. Some followed the humans for various reasons while others stayed behind. They formed their own "societies" and to this day still remain at peace with one another, their only quarrel with the occasional human that wanders down the wrong path.
<br><br>
Lets step back a moment and talk about one tree in particular. This particular tree was known as the "Tree of Illusion" because water would gather in such a way over its leaves that at night, it appeared to be made of light, shining many colors like a prism, but during the daylight would appear like any other tree around it. This tree began a human kingdom of cultural and scientific studies, humble beings on a quest for knowledge. When these humans attempted to make elixirs from the bark or the leaves, it instead created poisons and hallucinogens that harmed their minds, so out of respect and fear, the people refused to touch the tree any further. When this tree bore fruit, spiritual beings were born that carried with them these same properties. They were masters of illusion, poison, and hallucination. These creatures were given the forms of the common "fox" to blend with the human society as nonthreatening animals, which was a major advantage. However, like many of their fellow demons, these creatures could shift into humanoid forms and even infiltrate the human world that way. These beings became known as the mighty "Kitsune" race.
<br><br>
When a society is created, there must be an "alpha" figurehead to keep things in order. This is where the O'Dama's finally enter our story. Even among their own, there was one who outshined the rest. He was born from the core of the tree itself, and proved to be more powerful than his bretheren. During the wars he led his clan to battle as a wolf might lead his pack, but even the Kitsunes would revert back to the instincts of their own animal. Foxes themselves tend to be friendly to their own kind, but don't stick in large families, so as soon as the wars were over his people scattered across the worlds. This made full-blooded Kitsunes a rarity, and even moreso, the great O'Dama Kitsune.
<br><br>
As time passed, the great Alpha O'Dama--simply known as I--went on to have six children who bore the responsibility, power, and blood of the O'Dama name. Eventually, these children scattered as well, but it was known throughout their race that they were a council of judgement for their king.
</div>

<div id="tab4">
<h1>The Festival</h1>
The Festival is a very important time for O'Damas and any kitsune/fox spirit that are aware of their elite upper-class-rulers. For O'Damas themselves, the Festival's purpose is to honor their birth and victory in the Great War. For their (as the elite seven would claim) "lesser" comrades, the Festival is a time to honor their upper class. The celebration itself is a colorful event with lots of activities for all ages; drinking, feasting, fireworks, activities and games, opportunities and prepared places for sleep, on and on. It's basically a colorful and expensive college frat party that lasts an entire week without stopping, even for a short rest.
The location of the Festival is always the same, at the tree which gave this majestic race life. Thousands and thousands of years of great care and healthy unthreatened growth have made this fantastic tree look like something out of that ridiculously long movie most of you would know as "Avatar." For those of you that might not, think of it this way. The O'Damas made that tree into a castle, a home base of monarchy. If the word "castle" isn't enough to jog that imagination, just remember that during the Festival, the world's entire population of fox-related-creatures are welcome to come, stay in the tree, and participate in all the activities, and there's still room for more beings during the actual celebration!
That is one freaking huge tree.
-Note- All races and species are welcome to join the celebration.
<br><br>
<h1>Marriage / Mating</h1>
Some may be wondering why there are only seven pureblood O'Damas, where is the eighth? Where is their mother? This is one of my personal favorite things about this race. There were never eight, there were always seven, because the mother of the six children and Lord I, their father, are one in the same.
Allow me to explain. You see, when an O'Dama takes on a mate, the whole idea humans have about "two people becoming one in marriage" symbolism is quite literal for them. Lord I and Lady I were at one point separate beings, a male and female apart from one another. When they declared one another as official mates (basically getting married) and did the first deed (had sex, let's just be blunt), the two beings quite literally formed together to create one. Can they separate at will? Physically yes, but spiritually and mentally they will forever be two halves of one conscious. This is why Lord I's human form looks very feminine and masculine at once, for he is a male and female combined. When embracing his true form, Lord I separates into the two original O'Damas, but they are still connected in body, mind, and soul (like two sides of one brain) and so they move, act, and think as one, even when separate. This is why there are seven and not eight.
This is also why O'Damas are slightly disgusted with humans and their halfling offspring (fox nekos), who take sex lightly and use it for "fun" and "entertainment." Once the deed is done the first time, they are connected as one to that other being for the rest of their lives. This is also why O'Damas take relationships and marriage very seriously, and do not accept the existence of divorce.
This simple difference in culture can make interactions between humans and O'Damas offensive and difficult, since neither can truly understand the other.
